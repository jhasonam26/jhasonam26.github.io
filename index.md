## Welcome to Sonam Vinodkumar Jha's homepage
<span style="font-size:1.35em;">
I am currently a postdoctoral researcher in the <a href="https://scheidtgroup.northwestern.edu/">Scheidt Research Group</a> at Northwestern University, working under the supervision of <a href="https://www.feinberg.northwestern.edu/faculty-profiles/az/profile.html?xid=29727">Dr. Gary Schiltz</a> and <a href="https://chemistry.northwestern.edu/people/core-faculty/profiles/karl-scheidt.html">Dr. Karl A. Scheidt</a>.</span>

<span style="font-size:1.35em;">
Before joining Scheidt Research Group, I also worked in the <a href="https://anlab.umbc.edu/principal-investigator/">Songon An Laboratory</a> at UMBC, Maryland, under the guidance of <a href="https://chemistry.umbc.edu/faculty/songon-an/">Dr. Songon An</a> and <a href="https://chemistry.umbc.edu/faculty/minjoung-kyoung/">Dr. Minjoung Kyoung</a>.</span>

<span style="font-size:1.35em;">
I completed my PhD degree in medicinal chemistry from Keimyung University, South Korea, under the mentorship of <a href="https://www.walshmedicalmedia.com/editor/young-ho-seo-10652">Dr. Young Ho Seo</a>.</span>

<span style="font-size:1.35em;">
My doctoral research focused on designing, synthesizing, purifying, and characterizing diverse small molecule inhibitors, including HDAC6 inhibitors, HSP90 inhibitors, and HDAC6-HSP90 dual inhibitors, aimed at targeted chemotherapeutic effects, primarily against cancer and drug addiction. Additionally, I engaged in the design and synthesis of complex molecules such as PROTAC degraders for HDAC6. My proficiency extends to synthesizing compounds at a large scale for in-vivo studies. Furthermore, I have conducted various cancer cell studies and in-vitro biological assays, encompassing MTS/MTT assays, HDAC enzyme assays, Western Blotting, Colony Formation, and FACs, to comprehensively evaluate the biological effects of the synthesized molecules. </span>

<span style="font-size:1.35em;">
Presently, I am dedicated to unraveling the expression of glycolytic enzymes responsible for the formation of Glucosomes in Cancer cells.</span>
