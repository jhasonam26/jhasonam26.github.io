## Welcome to Sonam Vinodkumar Jha's homepage
<span style="font-size:1.35em;">
I recently have joined the chemistry and biochemistry department at UMBC, Maryland, USA, as a postdoctoral researcher. This year in February, I completed my PhD degree in medicinal chemistry from Keimyung University, South Korea, under the mentorship of <a href="https://www.walshmedicalmedia.com/editor/young-ho-seo-10652">Dr. Young Ho Seo</a>.</span>

<span style="font-size:1.35em;">
My doctoral research focused on designing, synthesizing, purifying, and characterizing diverse small molecule inhibitors, including HDAC6 inhibitors, HSP90 inhibitors, and HDAC6-HSP90 dual inhibitors, aimed at targeted chemotherapeutic effects, primarily against cancer and drug addiction. Additionally, I engaged in the design and synthesis of complex molecules such as PROTAC degraders for HDAC6. My proficiency extends to synthesizing compounds at a large scale for in-vivo studies. Furthermore, I have conducted various cancer cell studies and in-vitro biological assays, encompassing MTS/MTT assays, HDAC enzyme assays, Western Blotting, Colony Formation, and FACs, to comprehensively evaluate the biological effects of the synthesized molecules. </span>

Presently, I am dedicated to unraveling the expression of glycolytic enzymes responsible for the formation of Glucosomes in Cancer cells.</span>
